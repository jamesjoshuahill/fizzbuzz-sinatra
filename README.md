FizzBuzz in Sinatra
===================

### Makers Academy Week 5 pairing task

This task was set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen
[@ecomba](http://twitter.com/ecomba) whilst learning to code at
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). The aim was to make our first
Sinatra web service using the Fizzbuzz algorithm we wrote earlier in the course.

I paried with [Kiy Tang](https://github.com/kiytang) and together we wrote a
simple Sinatra web service that displays FizzBuzz up to a given number.

We write simple views in ERB and styled them with CSS. Our design choices could
be improved. This code was written without tests, which is not best practice and
some simple acceptance testing could be added to verify this code.
