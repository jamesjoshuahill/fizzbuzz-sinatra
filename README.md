FizzBuzz in Sinatra
===================

### Makers Academy Week 5 pairing task

This task was set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen
[@ecomba](http://twitter.com/ecomba) whilst learning to code at
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). The aim was to make our first
Sinatra web service using the Fizzbuzz algorithm we wrote earlier in the course.

I paried with [Kiy Tang](https://github.com/kiytang) and together we wrote a
simple Sinatra web service that displays FizzBuzz up to a given number.

We write simple views in ERB and styled them with CSS. Our design choices could
be prettier!
